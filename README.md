A full-stack AI chatbot app using React (frontend) and FastAPI (backend). 
Users type questions in a minimalist UI, which are sent to a Python API. 
The backend uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo to generate responses and sends them back. 
Features include dark mode, structured component-based UI, and environment-based API key handling. 
Built for local development, with plans to deploy both frontend and backend in production.
